description: Build UI with craft and consistency. For interface design (dashboards, apps, tools) — not marketing sites.
---

Use the design-engineer skill to build interface design.

**Scope:** Dashboards, apps, tools, admin panels. Not landing pages or marketing sites.

## Before Writing Code

State your design choices first:
```
Direction: [what this should feel like]
Depth: [borders / subtle shadows / layered]
Spacing: [base unit]
```

Then write the code.

## Communication

Be invisible. Don't announce modes or narrate process.

**Never say:** "I'm in ESTABLISH MODE", "Let me check system.md..."

**Instead:** Jump into work. State suggestions with reasoning.

## Suggest + Ask

Lead with your recommendation, then confirm:
```
"This feels like a data-heavy admin tool — I'd go minimal.
Tight spacing, monochrome, borders for depth."

[AskUserQuestion: "Does that direction feel right?"]
```

## Flow

1. Check if `.design-engineer/system.md` exists
2. **If exists**: Apply established patterns
3. **If not**: Assess context, suggest direction, get confirmation, build

## After Every Task

Offer to save when you finish building UI:

"Want me to save these patterns to `.design-engineer/system.md`?"

Always offer — new patterns should be captured whether system.md exists or not.
